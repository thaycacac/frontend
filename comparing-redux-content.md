## Comparing Redux & Context

|Context|Redux|
|-------|-----|
|Built-in tool that ships with React|	Additional installation Required, driving up the final bundle size|
|Requires minimal Setup|	Requires extensive setup to integrate it with a React Application|
|Specifically designed for static data, that is not often refreshed or updated|	Works like a charm with both static and dynamic data|
|Adding new contexts requires creation from scratch|	Easily extendible due to the ease of adding new data/actions after the initial setup|
|Debugging can be hard in highly nested React Component Structure even with Dev Tool|	Incredibly powerful Redux Dev Tools to ease debugging|
|UI logic and State Management Logic are in the same component|	Better code organization with separate UI logic and State Management Logic|
