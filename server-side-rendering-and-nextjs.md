# Why server-side rendering? 

Some server-side rendering advantages include:

- A server-side rendered application enables pages to load faster, improving the user experience.
- When rendering server-side, search engines can easily index and crawl content because the content can be rendered before the page is loaded, which is ideal for SEO. 
- Webpages are correctly indexed because web browsers prioritize web pages with faster load times.
- Rendering server-side helps efficiently load webpages for users with slow internet connection or outdated devices.
